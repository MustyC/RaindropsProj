## Raindrops

A function that takes an integer as its input and converts it to a string, which depends on many factors.

## Description

- If the input has a factor of 3, the returned string will be 'Pling'
- If the input has a factor of 5, the returned string will be 'Plang'
- If the input has a factor of 7, the returned string will be 'Plong'
- If the input does not have a factor of 3, 5 or 7, it will simply return the value of the digits.

## Examples

- 28's factors are 1, 2, 4, 7, 14 and 28: this would return a simple 'Plong'
- 30's factors are 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 30: this would return a 'PlingPlang'
- 34 has four factors: 1, 2, 17, and 34: this would return '34'
